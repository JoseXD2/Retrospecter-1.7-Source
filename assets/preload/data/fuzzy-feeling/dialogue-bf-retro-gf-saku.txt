:bf-retro:Flushed:Whoa, what--

:sakuromas:Horny:Flirt:I know how you are with one of us. How will you react to two?

:bf-retro:Confused: Last year? I probably would've been all "AWOOGA!".
:bf-retro:Sad: But times have changed. Seeing the behavior of others towards you made me realize how bad I was.
:bf-retro:Sad: A lot of this dialogue is outdated, and even if I do slap a "non-canon" disclaimer on it, that's not going to stop some people from thinking it is.
:bf-retro:Sad: I just wanted to have fun with character dialogue combinations, but having your own sona and the incarnation of Lust, made it hard.
:bf-retro:Sad: So I resorted to "Haha sex", but people took that as me projecting my own fetishes into my passion project.
:bf-retro:Sad: Do I wanna bang the moth? Of course. A lot of people I know do. But this moth has also really messed up some stuff.
:bf-retro:Sad: A lot of my friends can't even see Saku the same way anymore because of the way some of her fans act towards her in public.
:bf-retro:Sad: It even affected my own boyfriend, and that's not okay.
:bf-retro:Sad: She has a crowd of people that despise her with every fiber of their being-
:bf-retro:Sad: -And a crowd of people that want to do 5000 different naughty things with her. There is no in-between.
:bf-retro:Sad: I just hope that, if we do make a Vs. Saku, after Part 2 (which is unlikely), that we can do Saku justice and fix her character.

:bf-retro:Sad: Sorry. I tend to ramble.
