:iceolation:Crying:Why do you even want me around?!
:iceolation:Neutral:All I do is cause you trouble.

:zerktro-R:Sad:BECAUSE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO GAVE ME A CHANCE.
:zerktro-R:Sad:I CAME UP HERE TO RUN AWAY FROM MY RESPONSIBILITIES.
:zerktro-R:Happy:BUT THEN YOU SHOWED ME WHAT IT MEANT TO FEEL TRUE HAPPINESS.

:zerktro-R:Talking:I DON'T HAVE ANYONE BESIDES YOU. EVERYONE ELSE THINKS I'M A RUTHLESS MONSTER.
:zerktro-R:Talking:BUT NO MATTER HOW ANGRY I GET, YOU'RE ALWAYS THERE FOR ME. THROUGH THICK AND THIN.
:setFont:aApiNyala.ttf|60
:zerktro-R:Happy:SO I WANT TO DO THE SAME FOR YOU.

:iceolation:Neutral:I mean, you kind of are a monster.
:iceolation:Happy:You ARE the sin of Wrath, after all.

:zerktro-R:Eyeroll:HAHA. VERY FUNNY.
:zerktro-R:Neutral:COME ON, LET'S SIT FOR A BIT.

:angryEnding:

:zerktro-R:Neutral:MAN, LOOK AT THIS MESS YOU MADE.

:iceolation:Happy:Well, you're here, so the snow will melt before anyone notices.

:setFont:aApiNyala.ttf|60
:zerktro-R:Neutral:OH YEAH. I GUESS THAT'S TRUE.
:zerktro-R:Neutral:...
:zerktro-R:Happy:This scenery is beautiful.

:retro-right:Neutral:Nah, I totally get it.
:retro-right:Question:So, "Iceolation" huh?
:retro-right:Neutral:It's a cool name.
:retro-right:Smug:For a nerd.

:setFont:vcr.ttf|40
:ace-left:Smug:Whatever you say "Zerktro".

:setFont:EastSeaDokdo.ttf|60
:retro-right:Blush:Look, it sounded cooler in my head. "Berserker RetroSpecter" is such a mouthful.

:setFont:vcr.ttf|40
:ace-left:Happy:Haha, I'm just teasing you.
:ace-left:Blush:Love you.

:setFont:EastSeaDokdo.ttf|60
:retro-right:Smug:I love you too.
